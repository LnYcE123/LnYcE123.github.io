  <p>As the little prince dropped off to sleep. I took him in my arms and set out walking once more. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.</span> <span class="highlight"> It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</span> In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself: <span style="color:red">"What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible...</span>
    As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again: <span style="color:red">"What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower--the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep..."</span> And I felt him to be more fragile still. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I felt the need of protecting him. as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind .</span></p>
